function backup(or_dir,varargin)
%
%backup(or_dir,bk_dir,warn,flags,mode)
%
%
%Function for backing up directories by copying only the files that has been
%modified. This is a simple wrapper call to the XCOPY DOS command with some default flags.
%
%or_dir -(string) original directory to back-up
%bk_dir -(string) back-up (destination) directory
%warn   -(logical) If true (default) will comfirm the user if the source and
%         destination directories are correct
%flags  -(string) Flags to XCOPY command. Default is: '/M /E /F /Y /D /H'
%mode   -(string) Determines the operation mode. Options are:
%        'xcopy'  : (default) will call xcopy DOS command with respective flags
%        'prune'  : calls xcopy command and then delete files in the backup directry that 
%                     do not exist in the original directory
%        'sync'   : syncs both directories. BOTH directories are backep up with the most
%                     up-to-date files from either directory.
%        'find'   : find files and foders in the backup directory that do not exist in the original directory
%        'arch'   : set the archive attribute to ON of files in the original directory that do not exist
%                     on the back-up directory
%
%
% IMPORTANT NOTE: for the 'prune' method, deleting files in the backup
% that does not exist  the original file will not go to recycling bin unless
% you change the default MATLAB setting.
% To set the recycle state for all MATLAB sessions, use the Preferences
% dialog box. Open the Preferences dialog and select General. To enable or
% disable recycling, click Move files to the recycle bin or Delete files
% permanently. See General Preferences for MATLAB in the Desktop Tools and
% Development Environment documentation for more information.
%
%
% Possible Flag optinos are (Windows 2000 and XP ) this will overwrite default flags:
%
% /A Copies only files with the archive attribute set, doesn't change the attribute.
% /M Copies only files with the archive attribute set, turns off the archive attribute.
% /D:m-d-y Copies files changed on or after the specified date. If no date is given, copies only those files whose source time is newer than the destination time.
% /EXCLUDE:file1 [+file2][+file3]... Specifies a list of files containing strings. When any of the strings match any part of the absolute path of the file to be copied, that file will be excluded from being copied. For example, specifying a string like \obj\ or .obj will exclude all files underneath the directory obj or all files with the .obj extension respectively.
% /P Prompts you before creating each destination file.
% /S Copies directories and subdirectories except empty ones.
% /E Copies directories and subdirectories, including empty ones. Same as /S /E. May be used to modify /T.
% /V Verifies each new file.
% /W Prompts you to press a key before copying.
% /C Continues copying even if errors occur.
% /I If destination does not exist and copying more than one file, assumes that destination must be a directory.
% /Q Does not display file names while copying.
% /F Displays full source and destination file names while copying.
% /L Displays files that would be copied.
% /H Copies hidden and system files also.
% /R Overwrites read-only files.
% /T Creates directory structure, but does not copy files. Does not include empty directories or subdirectories. /T /E includes empty directories and subdirectories.
% /U Copies only files that already exist in destination.
% /K Copies attributes. Normal Xcopy will reset read-only attributes.
% /N Copies using the generated short names.
% /O Copies file ownership and ACL information.
% /X Copies file audit settings (implies /O).
% /Y Suppresses prompting to confirm you want to overwrite an existing destination file.
% /-Y Causes prompting to confirm you want to overwrite an existing destination file.
% /Z Copies networked files in restartable mode
%
% %Example this will back-up your work directory (without changing the archive attribute)!!!
% bk_dir=[matlabroot,'\backup'];
% or_dir=[matlabroot,'\work'];
% backup(or_dir,bk_dir,[],'/a /y');
